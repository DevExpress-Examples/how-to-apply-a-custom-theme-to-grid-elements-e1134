# How to apply a custom theme to grid elements

We do not support this example starting from **v.12.1**. For versions **prior to v.12.1**, use the approach illustrated in other branches of this example.

In newer versions, you can create a custom theme by using a tool depending on your DX controls version:

* **v.18.2 and newer**: use the [WPF Theme Designer](http://docs.devexpress.com/WpfThemeDesigner/118707/wpf-theme-designer).

* **v.12.1 - v.18.1**: use the [Theme Editor for WPF](https://stackedit.io/%22https://docs.devexpress.com/WpfThemeEditor/10429/wpf-theme-editor).
